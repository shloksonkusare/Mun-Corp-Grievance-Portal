**Make sure you have following versions of the setup installed**.
- Node JS 22.21.1 LTS

## Dataset Links and Directory Structure

- Road & Garbage Dataset: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zndzygc3p3/2
- Street Light Dataset (Electricity Issues): https://github.com/Team16Project/Street-Light-Dataset

Or you can use the following dataset made by me: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shloksonkusare2/municipal-social-issues-dataset/data

#### Directory Structure
- Arrange the dataset properly in the following structure
```
ai_model/
    dataset/
        train/
            DamagedRoads/               image1.jpg  image2.jpg ...
            ElectricityIssues/          ...
            GarbageAndSanitation/       ...
        val/
            DamagedRoads/               image1.jpg  image2.jpg ...
            ElectricityIssues/          ...
            GarbageAndSanitation/       ...
```
- To add the classes, simply add the folder as a new class in the dataset folder and add images in it.
